Embedded Software Lab 5 Project

This project has two parts. The first part (Part 1) uses an ATMega328P board and a photoresistor to brighten and dim an external LED according to the ambient light detected by said photoresistor. The second part (Part 2) uses the ATMega328P board and a potentiometer to have a piezoelectric buzzer emit a sound of varying frequency; and this variation will depend on the angle the knob of the potentiometer is turned to.

This project is broken up into two files: "main.c", and "main2.c". The former contains Part 1 of this project, the latter contains Part 2 of the project.
